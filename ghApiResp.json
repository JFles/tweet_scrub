Before\r\nthis commit, we were not sending the content filter to the proper\r\ndata query param documented here:\r\nhttps://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-dns/v1/api-reference/records/#search-records\r\n\r\nHowever, once the param was updated to the right name, Rackspace was\r\nreturning 503 errors for any request that included the data filter.\r\nThis seems to be a bug on Rackspace's end. Also tried sending just\r\na data param without the name param and still received a 503. Also tried\r\nstripping out any non-alphanumeric characters from the content and\r\nstill received a 503 (the docs say: Using special characters in a search\r\n such as \" \" and \"_\" causes no results to be returned). I noted these issues\r\nin pull request #189 and ended up closing that pull request because of the\r\n503 errors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve it, I removed trying to use the content/data filter in the API request.\r\nIt fetches the list filtering on type and name and then applies the content filter\r\non the list in python.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

                "body": "My environment: Lua 5.3.4 on MacOS 10.13.3\r\n\r\n`fennel.searcher` returns a function that takes an options table, then calls `fennel_dofile` with the filename and the options. However, `require` passes the name of the module rather than options. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel/blob/1c46182e5838f5d4e9885fe5c39074b68b0f7fba/fennel.lua#L1361-L1368\r\n\r\nSo for example, when I run:\r\n```\r\n;; File: require-test.fnl\r\n;; Env: fennel.lua and helpers.fnl are in same directory\r\n\r\n(set fennel (require :fennel))\r\n(table.insert package.searchers fennel.searcher)\r\n(set helpers (require :helpers))\r\n```\r\n\r\n`fennel_dofile` ends up being called like `fennel_dofile(\"./helpers.fnl\", \"helpers\")`. This results in an error when the code tries to set `options.filename`, so the require fails. This may be due to a difference in the way `require` works in Lua 5.1 and in 5.2+.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lua 5.1 manual:\r\n> Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with a single argument, modname.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lua 5.2 manual (same in 5.3):\r\n> Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with two arguments: modname and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the loader came from a file, this extra value is the file name.)\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm a bit puzzled because it seems from those descriptions that the loader will always be called with a string value, so it should also error on 5.1. (Just assuming that it works on 5.1 because the package.loaders used in the documentation becomes package.searchers in 5.2+)"

We tried to start with a few easy patch-level updates. Hopefully your tests will pass and you can merge this pull request without too much risk. This should give you an idea how Depfu works in general.\n\nAfter you merge your first pull request, we'll send you a few more. We'll never open more than seven PRs at the same time so you're not getting overwhelmed with updates.\n\n[Let us know](mailto:hi@depfu.com) if you have any questions. Thanks so much for giving Depfu a try!\n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>⚠️ <b>No CI detected</b> ⚠️</summary>\n<p>You don't seem to have any Continuous Integration service set up!</p>\n\n<p>Without a service that will test the Depfu branches and pull requests, we can't inform you if incoming updates actually work with your app. We think that this degrades the\nservice we're trying to provide down to a point where it is more or less meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>This is fine if you just want to give Depfu a quick try. If you want to really let Depfu help you keep your app up-to-date, we recommend setting up a CI system:</p>\n\n * Our friends at [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) provide excellent service.\n * [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) are good, too, and have a free plan that will cover basic needs.\n * If you use something like Jenkins, make sure that you're using the Github integration correctly so that it reports status data back to Github.\n * If you have already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check your configuration. Make sure it will run on all new branches. If you don’t want it to run on every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with `depfu/`.\n\n<p>It might be necessary to once deactivate and reactivate your project in Depfu for the CI service to be properly detected.</p>\n<hr>\n</details>\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n\n🚨 <b>Your version of rails-html-sanitizer has known security vulnerabilities</b> 🚨\n\nAdvisory: CVE-2018-3741\nDisclosed: March 22, 2018\nURL: [https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/f3ba1a839a35f2ba7f941c15e239a1cb379d56ae](https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/f3ba1a839a35f2ba7f941c15e239a1cb379d56ae)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Possible XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer</summary>\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<br>\n🚨 <b>We recommend to merge and deploy this update as soon as possible!</b> 🚨\n<hr>\n\n\nWe've updated a dependency and here is what you need to know:\n\n| name | version specification | old version | new version |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| rails-html-sanitizer | _indirect dependency_ | 1.0.2 | 1.0.4 |\n\nAdditionally, the update changed a few other dependencies as well:\n\n| action | name | old version | new version |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| added | crass |  | 1.0.3 |\n| added | mini_portile2 |  | 2.1.0 |\n| removed | mini_portile | 0.6.2 | |\n| updated | loofah | 2.0.2 | 2.2.2 |\n| updated | nokogiri | 1.6.6.2 | 1.6.8.1 |\n\n\nYou should probably take a good look at the info here and the test results before merging this pull request, of course.\n\n### What changed?\n\n\n#### ↗️ rails-html-sanitizer (_indirect_, 1.0.2 → 1.0.4) · [Repo](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer) · [Changelog](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Release Notes</summary>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/releases/tag/v1.0.4\">Github release</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fix CVE-2018-3741.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/compare/4f0f7810fce6c8aa63de07a40d69d6027a30acaf...53bf066ac3a163546a9c7c44c30998c21068c42d\">See the full diff on Github</a>.
